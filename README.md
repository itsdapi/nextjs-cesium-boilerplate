# Cesium boilerplate project with NextJs 14

> Code are mostly come from [nextjs-ts-cesium-example](https://github.com/hyundotio/nextjs-ts-cesium-example)

I did some personal preference including:

- top level accessible cesium viewer
- entrance for adding entity
- better way (imo) to manage entity
- better looking code by making `useMap` hook
- support for responsive design

# TODO

There is something that I still need to working on

- HMR

# Something else

- Why not using Resium?

Yeah. GIS community I think currently is not really active especially among React community. 
So using vanilla cesium is just to avoid some weird bug and have better community support.
